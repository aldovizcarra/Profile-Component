## My process

First I created the html markup. I then created the background first. It was hard to recreate the background, so I had some help from a discord server. 
After creating the background, I made the profile card using flexbox.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this project I learned how to crop background images.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning css flexbox and other aspects of css, like css grid and bootstrap.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell Discord](https://discord.gg/wqTAvQJE) - This helped me recreate the background.
